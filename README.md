# CPP-SWIG-distutils
Created a toy application in C++ which revolves around extending templated class of C++ in Python. <br>
Compilation and build is taken care by setup.py file <br>
For higher level abstraction just run compileScript.sh file by typing following command in terminal <br>
```
./compileScript.sh
```
